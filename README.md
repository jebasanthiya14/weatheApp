HelloWeather is a responsive weather forecasting web application that provides real-time weather updates for cities across Tamil Nadu and India.
It fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API to display the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and a 5-day weather forecast.
The app also supports city name search with autocomplete suggestions, and can fetch weather based on the user’s current location using the browser’s geolocation API.
